# About Application:

* It is an ecommerce application, I have used React, Redux for building the application. Created a dummy API using typicode(link : https://my-json-server.typicode.com/).
* Open the application using the above host link.
* You can see the products in the home page, each product have it's own description, edit button, delete and add to cart button.
* On clicking the product you will be navigated to the product page.
* Each button has it's respective fuctionality.
* In the navbar, you will find an option for adding the products to the application. On clicking which you will be redirected to the Form where you can fill up the required data and add the product.
* On adding the product, there won't be any changes made to the db file from where the data is being fetched as it is a dummy API.
* On the navbar there is an option to check the items present in the cart, where you can check the total price of all the items. Also the count is mentioned over the cart icon.


## How to create the Dummy API:

* Create a repository in github.
* Create a db.json file in the repository.
* Add the data into the db.json file as mentioned in the below link:
    #### gitRepo Link : https://github.com/AfredHussain-T/productData/blob/main/db.json

* Use the API as mentioned here `https://my-json-server.typicode.com/<git-profile>/<repoName>/`

* Ex: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/AfredHussain-T/productData/
* You are good to go with the dummy API.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
